As technology advances, criminal minds are evolving and are turning towards new ways of attacking banks and financial institutions. These institutes are now vulnerable to several information security threats. There is a sudden rush in the number of cyber-attacks, causing unrest in institutions. Issues related to legal, regulatory, and privacy compliance are constantly endangering these institutions. Considering the situation, an ideal approach will be to focus on the detection of attack and reduction of cyber security risks across multiple channels. The lack of proper forensic analysis tools and incident management can adversely affect an institution by increasing the downtime and the investigation expenses. Also this results in a lack of evidence collection leading to ineffective investigation.
